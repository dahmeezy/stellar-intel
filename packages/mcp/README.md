# @stellarintel/mcp

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for
[Stellar Intel](https://github.com/ezedike-evan/stellar-intel), built on
[`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
and served over stdio.

## Status

`createServer()` (`src/server.ts`) stands up the MCP server and registers two
tools, both backed directly by
[`lib/mcp/offramp.ts`](https://github.com/ezedike-evan/stellar-intel/blob/main/lib/mcp/offramp.ts)
in the main app (imported at build time — see below), so this package and the
in-repo dev server at
[`scripts/mcp/server.ts`](https://github.com/ezedike-evan/stellar-intel/blob/main/scripts/mcp)
(see [`docs/MCP.md`](https://github.com/ezedike-evan/stellar-intel/blob/main/docs/MCP.md))
share the exact same logic:

- `intel.offramp.quote` — live net-received quote for a corridor + amount.
  The rate is sourced from the routed anchor's own current price (SEP-38
  firm quote, falling back to SEP-24/SEP-6 fee-adjusted live FX), not a
  static table — it can return `RATE_UNAVAILABLE` if the anchor can't
  currently be quoted.
- `intel.offramp.prepare` — unsigned intent envelope + unsigned Stellar
  transaction for agent signing.

### Build

This package's `tsc` build reaches across the workspace into the main app's
`lib/`, `constants/`, and `types/` trees (via `rootDir`/`paths` in
`tsconfig.json`) so it reuses the same off-ramp logic instead of duplicating
it, then rewrites the `@/` path aliases to real relative `require()`s with
[`tsc-alias`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsc-alias) so the published
`dist/` is self-contained and runnable with plain `node` outside this
monorepo. `main`/`bin` point at `dist/packages/mcp/src/index.js` — the
mirrored path is a side effect of `rootDir` spanning the repo root.

## Install

```bash
npm install @stellarintel/mcp
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run build   # tsc -> dist/
npm start       # node dist/index.js, stdio transport
npm run dev     # same, via ts-node, no build step
```

Point any MCP-capable client (Claude Desktop, an agent framework, etc.) at
the built `dist/index.js` as a stdio command.
